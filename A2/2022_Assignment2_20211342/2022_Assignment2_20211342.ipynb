    "**This homework focuses on training and evaluating prediction models for a particular problem and dataset.**\n",
    "The data comes from the Residential Property Price Register (RPPR) (https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-en). The Residential Property Price Register is produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA). It includes Date of Sale, Price and Address of all residential properties purchased in Ireland since the 1st January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes. In this analysis, **we focus on using the data collected by RPPR to build and evaluate a data analytics solution for residential property price prediction**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in this homework is to work with the data to build and evaluate prediction models that capture the relationship between the descriptive features and the target feature **Price**. For this homework you are asked to use the same dataset allocated to you in Homework1 (you can use your cleaned/prepared CSV from Homework1 or start from the raw dataset, clean it according to concepts covered in the lectures/labs, then use it for training prediction models).\n",
    " \n",
    "There are 5 parts for this homework. Each part has an indicative maximum percentage given in brackets, e.g., part (1) has a maximum of 25% shown as [25]. The total that can be achieved is 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). [25] **Data Understanding and Preparation:** Exploring relationships between feature pairs and selecting/transforming promising features based on a given training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (1.1) Randomly shuffle the rows of your dataset and split the dataset into two datasets: 70% training and 30% test. Keep the test set aside. \n",
    "    - (1.2) On the training set:\n",
    "        - Plot the correlations between all the continuous features (if any). Discuss what you observe in these plots.\n",
    "        - For each continuous feature, plot its interaction with the target feature (a plot for each pair of continuous feature and target feature). Discuss what you observe from these plots, e.g., which continuous features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of continuous features you find promising (if any). Justify your choices.\n",
    "        - For each categorical feature, plot its pairwise interaction with the target feature. Discuss what knowledge you gain from these plots, e.g., which categorical features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of categorical features you find promising (if any). Justify your choices.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    \n",
    "(2). [15] **Predictive Modeling and Evaluation:** Linear Regression.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - (2.1) On the training set, train a linear regression model to predict the target feature, using only the descriptive features selected in exercise (1) above. \n",
    "    - (2.2) Can you interpret the linear regression model? Discuss any knowledge you can gain in regard of the working of this model. \n",
    "    - (2.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 10 training examples. Print a few regression evaluation measures computed on the full training set and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (2.4) Evaluate the model using regression evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained on the training (70% examples) dataset. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset). You can use classic k-fold cross-validation or k repeated random train/test (70/30) splits. Compare the cross-validation metrics to those obtained on the single train/test split and discuss your findings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(3). [15] **Predictive Modeling and Evaluation:** Decision Tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - (3.1) On the training set, train a decision tree model to predict the target feature, using the descriptive features selected in exercise (1) above.   \n",
    "    - (3.2) Can you interpret the decision tree model? Discuss any knowledge you can gain in regard of the working of this model. \n",
    "    - (3.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 10 training examples. Print a few regression evaluation measures computed on the full training set and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (3.4) Evaluate the model using regression evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained on the training (70% examples) dataset. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset). You can use classic k-fold cross-validation or k repeated random train/test (70/30) splits. Compare the cross-validation metrics to those obtained on the single train/test split and discuss your findings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "(4). [20] **Predictive Modeling and Evaluation:** Random Forest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - (4.1) On the training set, train a random forest model to predict the target feature, using the descriptive features selected in exercise (1) above.   \n",
    "    - (4.2) Can you interpret the random forest model? Discuss any knowledge you can gain in regard of the working of this model.   \n",
    "    - (4.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 10 training examples. Print a few regression evaluation measures computed on the full training set and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (4.4) Evaluate the model using regression evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained on the training (70% examples) dataset. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset). You can use classic k-fold cross-validation or k repeated random train/test (70/30) splits. Compare the cross-validation metrics to those obtained on the single train/test split and to the random forest out-of-sample error and discuss your findings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(5). [25] **Improving Predictive Models.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (5.1) Which model of the ones trained above performs better at predicting the target feature? Is it more accurate than a simple model that always predicts the average price computed from the training set, for the same year as the test example? Justify your answers.\n",
    "    - (5.2) Summarise your understanding of the problem and of your predictive modeling results so far. Can you think of any new ideas to improve the best model so far (e.g., by using furher data prep such as: feature selection, feature re-scaling, creating new features, combining models, or using other knowledge)? Please show how your ideas actually work in practice, by training and evaluating your proposed models. Summarise your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (5.3) Take your best model trained and selected based on past data (i.e. your cleaned Homework1 dataset), and evaluate it on the new test dataset provided with this homework (in file '22032022-PPR-Price-recent.csv'). Note that the new test data has to be transformed using the same steps as the past training data, otherwise the trained model cannot be used for prediction on the new data. Discuss your findings.

    "- Reviewing the sorted correlation dataframe we get a better overview of all the correlations. \n",

    "    - YearMonth makes sense here as : There will be different economic environments and policies in different periods, and prices will be affected accordingly\n",
    "    - lng also seems like a good predictor. Property prices are most affected by location. \n",
    "- I will decide to keep the features that fall into the high correlation bins. The low correlations values will likely have little effect on the outcome and make the model more complicated.\n",

    "- Explanation: The k-fold cross-validation approach is more reasonable，in the cross_val_score the scores returned are calculated on the test data of each fold and then averaged. In the \"metrics.r2_score\" part, calculating the scores on the training data, which in most cases will have higher value, because the model has been trained on that data."

    "- 3 predictive models have been evaluated in this notebook, with all models preform similarly, except the linear regression model\n",
    "- About the over-fitting of linear regression model:\n",
    "  - The linear regression model is used here, and the phenomenon of over-fitting occurs, and the fitting effect of the training set is far better than that of the test set.\n",
    "  - Finding: Using the metrics.r2_score method, the score for the training set was 0.747, while the score for the test set turned out to be -1.425806396945729e+24. Moreover, using k-fold cross-validation to score the training set is similar to the score for the test set, which is very low.\n",
    "  - Explanation: k-fold cross-validation is more reasonable. In the cross_val_score the scores returned are calculated on the test data of each fold and then averaged. In the \"metrics.r2_score\" part, calculating the scores on the training data, which in most cases will have higher value, because the model has been trained on that data.\n",
    "- The majority of the features in the dataset have been found to have little impact on the target\n",
    "- A number of optimisations have been made that have improved all models\n",
    "- The biggest effect is finding the optimised list of features as this can be applied to all models"
